Whack-a-mole is one of the most famous games, your purpose is to whack moles that appear on the field.
After starting, the program creates a window in which a menu appears. User can press button "New game" and game starts. Menu will be gone then field with moles (inherritors of class Button) comes. A progress bar appears on the top left, a counter appears on the top right, showing the current score. The progress bar shows how much time is left for the game. Every second one mole that can be whacked appears. When you click on it, the counter increases by 1, mole diappears and also slightly increases the time until the end of the game. When there is no time left, the game field closes, after which a menu appears, on top of which there is a button with an inscription indicating the score of the game. When you press the button, it disappears, after which the menu reappears.
What will be added later: saving best scores into file, possibility to write your name to save score, changing of difficulty (size of field, mole spawn rate). Also there will be added normal graphics.
